# Bachelor-Thesis

My Bachelor's Thesis files.

I got my bachelor's degree in economics at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The thesis is all in Portuguese. It has some errors I need to fix, but here it is as I presented it.

As usual in Brazil, the official style for writing monographs is the one suggested by Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas (ABNT). My monograph abide by this style, so the template can be very helpful for another undegraduate students writing their theses. I used the [abntex2 package](https://github.com/abntex/abntex2) to do this.
